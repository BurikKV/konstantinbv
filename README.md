# Konstantin - QA & Cypress Solutions Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository, a curated showcase of my journey in mastering automated testing, particularly with Cypress. Over the past two years, I've dedicated myself to evolving my skill set in the realm of test automation, building on a robust foundation of over 9 years in the Hi-tech industry.

Hi there! My name is Konstantin. I started as a junior QA specialist and worked my way up to become a QA Lead and Senior QA Engineer. Since I started exploring automated testing with Cypress, this repository has captured the insights, challenges, and achievements I’ve encountered along the way.
